            <p>My heart is like a gentle cold breeze in spring,</p>
            <p>moving softly through everything.</p>
            <p>A quiet wind that learns how to stay,</p>
            <p>drifting calmly when you are near my way.</p>

            <p>Before you, my heart was ignored and small,</p>
            <p>now it is cherished, the safest place of all.</p>

            <p>You changed my heart with the curve of your smile,</p>
            <p>teaching me to see the small details worthwhile.</p>

            <p>When I notice you, I want to tell you everything,</p>
            <p>every fear, every dream I keep within.</p>
            <p>And I want to protect you from the darkness of this world,</p>
            <p>to be your light when your shadows are unfurled.</p>

            <p>I am grateful because my heart has found</p>
            <p>someone who lifts me when I am down.</p>
            <p>Now I live with a reason, steady and true,</p>
            <p>to become something better because of you.</p>

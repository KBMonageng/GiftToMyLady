            <p>My soul moves like a manta ray through open water,</p>
            <p>slow and weightless in the endless blue,</p>
            <p>guided by a quiet light it always knew.</p>

            <p>It is a ray of sunlight</p>
            <p>reaching the ground in a dense forest deep,</p>
            <p>a sacred warmth my spirit learns to keep.</p>

            <p>Before you, my soul was a calm lake,</p>
            <p>now it is a calm ocean wide and awake.</p>

            <p>You change my soul by the way you hold me near,</p>
            <p>with a touch that says I belong right here.</p>

            <p>When I am with you, my soul learns how to breathe,</p>
            <p>like sunlight returning to the forest beneath.</p>
